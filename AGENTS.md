# PI Dashboard

## Project Overview

Web-based dashboard for monitoring and interacting with pi agent sessions remotely. Three-component architecture: bridge extension + Node.js server + React web client.

## STOP — Docs-First Gate

**Before any build / run / install / setup / release / "how do I X" question: `grep -i <keyword> docs/faq.md README.md docs/` FIRST. No source reads until that returns nothing.**

If you read a script, config, or source file before grepping docs on a how-to, what-is question, you violated the protocol. Re-grep, then answer.

- ❌ User: "how do I ..." → read `<src files>` → guess answer
- ✅ User: "how do I ..." → `grep -ni '<words>' docs/faq.md` → quote the FAQ entry

- ❌ User: "what is ..." → read `scripts/build-installer.sh`, `forge.config.ts` → guess answer
- ✅ User: "what is ..." → `grep -ni '<words>' docs/index-*.md` → quote the entry

Full protocol (index-first for code questions, file-index splits, etc.) is in [Investigation Protocol — Index First](#investigation-protocol--index-first) below.

## Code Instructions

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask via `ask_user`.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- **Never speculate about code you have not opened.** If the user references a specific file, read it before answering. No claims about the codebase without investigation — grounded, hallucination-free answers only.
- Before any major change, check in with the user and confirm the plan.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- **DRY:** if the same pattern appears in multiple places, extract a shared helper/class/component. Don't pre-extract for a single call site.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution (TDD)

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For implementation, use **TDD**: write or update tests first to define expected behaviour, verify they fail, then write the minimal implementation to make them pass.

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

### 5. Communication

- At every step, give a high-level explanation of what changed — don't dump diffs without summary.
- Use `ask_user` (not plain-text questions) when you need clarification, confirmation, or a choice.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Documentation Update Protocol

**Default assumption: your update does NOT belong in AGENTS.md.** AGENTS.md loads into every agent's context on every turn — every byte costs tokens. Route by kind:

| Kind of update | Goes in |
|---|---|
| New file, or per-file detail / change-history / contract / "See change: …" annotation | Matching per-area split `docs/file-index-<area>.md` (see `docs/file-index.md`). Add row in path-alphabetical order. |
| New top-level area / new split file | New row in `docs/file-index.md` splits table. Pointer in AGENTS.md only if architectural backbone. |
| Data flow, persistence, reconnection, protocol, config reference | `docs/architecture.md` |
| End-user / developer setup, prerequisites, CI badges, project structure | `README.md` |
| Cross-cutting rule EVERY agent needs on EVERY turn (rare) | AGENTS.md, ≤ 200 chars per row, no inline change history |

Rules:

1. **AGENTS.md "Key Files" rows MUST stay ≤ 200 characters** — one terse purpose, no change-history, no contracts, no "See change: …" parentheticals.

2. **Per-file detail goes into `docs/file-index-<area>.md`.** Search the matching split for the path; if a row exists, append/update; else add in path-alphabetical order.

3. **If a split grows past ~50 KB**, sub-split it (e.g. `file-index-server-routes.md`) and update `docs/file-index.md`.

4. **Long-form docs** (architecture decisions, rationale, protocol details) belong in `docs/architecture.md` or `docs/<topic>.md`. Reference from AGENTS.md with a one-line pointer, never inline.

5. **When you create a new split doc**, add a one-line pointer in AGENTS.md so future agents find it.

6. **Every write under `docs/` MUST be delegated to a general-purpose subagent with the caveman-style rule passed verbatim in its prompt.** Main agent orchestrates, never edits `docs/` directly.

   **Caveman style** (all `docs/` prose — file-index rows, architecture notes, topic docs):
   - Short declarative fragments. Drop articles (a/an/the) and most copulas (is/are/was) when meaning survives.
   - Subject → verb → object, present tense. No hedging, no marketing voice, no "we", no "you".
   - One fact per line/row. No restating context the file already establishes.
   - Prefer concrete tokens (paths, function names, env vars, ports, exit codes) over prose.
   - Keep symbols/identifiers verbatim; only connective tissue compresses.
   - Example — verbose: "This module is responsible for parsing the user's input and then dispatching it to the correct handler based on the command prefix." Caveman: "Parses user input. Dispatches to handler by command prefix."

Why this exists: AGENTS.md ballooned to 107 KB (~27k tokens) by accreting per-change annotations on every row over months. Split was already done (file-index.md exists) but agents kept appending to AGENTS.md instead.

## Architecture

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for full details.
- See [docs/electron-bootstrap-flow.md](docs/electron-bootstrap-flow.md) for the Electron app→server bootstrap state machine and end states.

- **Bridge Extension** (`src/extension/`) — Runs in every pi session, forwards events via WebSocket
- **Dashboard Server** (`src/server/`) — Aggregates events, in-memory + JSON persistence, dual WebSocket servers
- **Web Client** (`src/client/`) — React + Tailwind responsive UI
- **Shared Types** (`src/shared/`) — Protocol definitions shared across components

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm test             # Run all tests (vitest)
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode
npm run test:bootstrap       # Run the bootstrap resolution harness only
npm run test:bootstrap:watch # Bootstrap harness in watch mode
npm run build        # Build web client (Vite)
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server
npm run reload       # Reload all connected pi sessions
npm run reload:check # Type-check + reload all pi sessions
pi-dashboard         # Start dashboard server
pi-dashboard --dev   # Start with Vite proxy
```

## Running Tests

Pipe test output to a tmp file, then grep — avoids re-running to inspect errors:

```bash
npm test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pi-test.log        # run once, capture all output
grep -nE 'FAIL|Error|✗|✘' /tmp/pi-test.log   # find failures
grep -n -A 20 'FAIL ' /tmp/pi-test.log        # failure + context
```

Always grep the file — never rerun `npm test` just to see errors.

## Cross-Platform QA Testing

VM-based QA testing for verifying clean-state installation and runtime across platforms.

```bash
cd qa
make build-linux-x86    # Build Ubuntu x86 base image (Packer + VMware)
make test-linux-x86     # Clone → boot → run tests → destroy
make manual-linux-x86   # Clone with GUI for manual testing
make clean              # Destroy all cloned VMs
```

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `qa/Makefile` | Build/test/manual/clean targets for all platforms |
| `qa/packer/*.pkr.hcl` | Packer templates per platform (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) |
| `qa/packer/scripts/` | Provisioning scripts (common, linux, macos, windows) |
| `qa/packer/vars/` | OS-version-specific variables (ISO URL, checksum, VM specs) |
| `qa/packer/http/` | Auto-install configs (cloud-init, autounattend.xml) |
| `qa/scripts/` | VM lifecycle (clone, wait-ssh, destroy, run-test) |
| `qa/tests/` | Test suite (install, server, websocket, terminal, git) |
| `qa/README.md` | Full setup and usage documentation |

## Investigation Protocol — Index First

**Before reading source, consult `docs/file-index.md` and the relevant `docs/file-index-<area>.md` split.** The index is the cheapest map of the codebase — every architecturally significant file has a one-line purpose plus change-history pointers. Reading source blind wastes tokens and risks hallucination.

**For "how do I X" / build / run / setup questions: grep `README.md` + `docs/` first.** These already document every supported workflow (build, install, release, QA, troubleshooting). Reading source before checking docs wastes tokens and produces wrong answers (e.g. claiming a feature is missing when it ships). Check `docs/faq.md` for recurring questions.

Workflow for any non-trivial "where is X" / "how does Y work" question:

1. **Pick the split** from `docs/file-index.md` table (shared / extension / server / client / electron / plugins / skills-misc) by path prefix or topic.
2. **Delegate harvesting to a subagent** (`Explore` preferred). Give it:
   - the user's question,
   - the split file(s) to read,
   - explicit instruction: *"return only rows + file paths relevant to the question — no source reads, no speculation."*
3. **Receive a short list** of candidate files (≤ ~10 rows). Only then open source for the ones that matter.
4. If the split lacks coverage, fall back to `rg` / `Explore` over the source tree — and add the missing row per the Documentation Update Protocol.

Why subagents: the splits are large (`file-index-server.md`, `file-index-client.md` each > 20 KB). Loading them into the main context on every question pollutes the budget. A subagent reads the split, returns the 5–10 relevant rows, and discards the rest.

Do **not**:
- Grep source before checking the index.
- Read a whole split file into the main agent's context — delegate.
- Trust the AGENTS.md "Key Files" backbone as exhaustive; it is a subset.

## Key Files

> **Full file map**: see [`docs/file-index.md`](docs/file-index.md) — a thin index of per-area split files (`docs/file-index-<area>.md`). Read the relevant split on demand when locating a file or understanding its full responsibilities (incl. change-history annotations).

This section lists only the **architectural backbone** — the files agents touch most often or need to know about for any non-trivial change. For everything else (renderers, individual tool cards, narrow helpers, build/CI internals) consult the appropriate split via `docs/file-index.md`.

## Build & Restart Workflow

The dashboard has three components that need rebuilding depending on what changed:

### After bridge extension changes (`src/extension/`)
Reload all connected pi sessions to pick up the new bridge code:
```bash
npm run reload          # Reload all pi sessions
npm run reload:check    # Type-check first, then reload
```

### After server changes (`src/server/`, `src/shared/`)
Restart the dashboard server. The server runs TypeScript directly via jiti (pi's TypeScript loader), so no separate build step is needed — just restart:
```bash
# Graceful restart via API (preserves current dev/prod mode)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/restart

# Or via CLI
pi-dashboard restart              # production mode
pi-dashboard restart --dev        # dev mode

# Manual stop + start
pi-dashboard stop && pi-dashboard start
pi-dashboard stop && pi-dashboard start --dev
```

### After client changes (`src/client/`)
- **Dev mode**: Vite hot-reloads automatically, no action needed. Start with `npm run dev`.
- **Production mode**: Rebuild the client and restart the server:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/restart
  ```

### After OpenSpec apply finishes (full rebuild)
When an openspec-apply-change skill completes implementation, do a full rebuild and restart:
```bash
npm run build
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/restart
npm run reload
```

### Check current mode
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health | jq .mode
# Returns "dev" or "production"
```

### Dev mode with production fallback
In `--dev` mode, the server proxies to Vite for HMR. If Vite is not running, it **automatically falls back** to serving the production build from `dist/client/`. This means `pi-dashboard start --dev` always works — no 502 errors.

### Fault-tolerant restart
- `POST /api/restart` waits for the old server to exit, starts a new one, and verifies health
- `POST /api/restart` with body `{"dev": true}` or `{"dev": false}` switches modes
- `pi-dashboard stop` kills stale processes holding the ports (via `lsof`), not just the PID file
- **Single restart path** (change: fix-restart-bridge-auto-start-race): `/api/restart` is the single source of truth. `pi-dashboard restart` (CLI) probes `isDashboardRunning(port)` and **delegates to `/api/restart`** when the dashboard is up; only when no dashboard is running does it fall back to local `cmdStop` + `cmdStart`. The `restart-helper.ts` orchestrator runs detached, kills the previous PID explicitly (SIGTERM → SIGKILL), then spawns the replacement. Before exit, the server broadcasts `server_restarting { reason, quiesceMs }` to every connected pi bridge so bridges suppress their auto-start spawn step for the quiesce window (5 s for restart, 60 s for shutdown) and don't race the orchestrator. Discovery + reconnection still run during the window so bridges pick up the new server as soon as it advertises.

## OpenSpec Conventions

When creating OpenSpec change artifacts, always place them at `openspec/changes/<name>/` — never nest under subdirectories like `active/` or `archive/`. Prefer using `openspec change new <name>` CLI to scaffold the directory structure correctly.

## Diagram Style

When creating diagrams, use Mermaid syntax (```mermaid blocks) instead of ASCII box drawings. This applies to explore mode, design documents, and all other artifacts.
